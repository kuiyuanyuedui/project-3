Hi Yuan, I am Yukun and I just went through your project and finished the code review.
You did an amazing job! The project is complete, everything works as designed, and I enjoy your innovative idea in the project.
One thing I've noticed is that the deployment link is not working, hope you can fix it! (Because of the subscription of Heroku?)

Other than that, you may also consider improving on usability and the design of the frontend, which will be covered in the coming courses.
Overall, you have done a great job and the project is satisfying!
Yukun
